### React Component Lifecycle Phases

#### Mounting

**Mounting** is like setting up a new gadget:

- **Constructor**: You set up initial things, like creating a new blueprint for how your gadget should look and work.
  
- **getDerivedStateFromProps**: You might adjust some settings based on new information you receive before starting.

- **Render**: You actually build the gadget based on the blueprint.

- **componentDidMount**: You turn on the gadget and start using it. This is where you do things like fetching data from the internet or setting timers.

#### Updating

**Updating** is like changing settings on your gadget:

- **getDerivedStateFromProps**: You adjust settings if the gadget gets new instructions.

- **shouldComponentUpdate**: You decide if it's worth making changes based on the new instructions. Sometimes, you might skip making changes if nothing important has changed.

- **Render**: You update the gadget to reflect any changes in settings.

- **componentDidUpdate**: You finish making changes and start using the updated gadget. This is where you might do things like animate changes or send updated data to a server.

#### Unmounting

**Unmounting** is like packing away your gadget:

- **componentWillUnmount**: You clean up any leftover things, like turning off timers or stopping any ongoing processes.

These phases help manage how components behave as they are created, updated with new information, and finally removed from use.
